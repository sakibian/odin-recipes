      Let's kick this off with a classic! Here's the original Buffalo-style
      chicken wing sauce. It's a quick, simple sauce that's booming with flavor.
      And all it takes are a few minutes on the stove. "If you know someone from
      Buffalo, they know someone who told them the secret ingredients to the
      Anchor Bar's famous Buffalo chicken wings," says Chef John. "I know people
      from Buffalo. This is my version, as described to me many years ago, over
      almost as many beers."
